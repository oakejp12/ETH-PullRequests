# ethpull

An ethereum-powered pull request system.

## Plan

Since merge/pull requests are sometimes a source of contention, I plan to build a decentralized voting system that takes advantage of third-party version control systems in order to approve merge/pull requests.

### Where Ethereum and Dapps make sense: 
* Need for multiple parties to coordinate and/or agree.
* Parties are competing so they don't trust each other.
* It wouldbe hard to trust a third party to run the infrastructure fairly and not abuse a monopoly position.

## TODO:
- [ ] Describe technical roadmap and how code could be tied to a smart contract.
